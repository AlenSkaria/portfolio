You know that moment when the syntax melts into rhythm, the logic becomes music, and your code editor turns into a canvas? That’s _vibe coding_.

It’s not about crunching leetcode problems or chasing deadlines. It’s that late-night flow where the world fades away and your fingers just _know_ what to write. The keyboard becomes an instrument. The bug becomes a puzzle. You don’t force it — you just **vibe**.

## What Makes a Good Vibe Coding Session?

- 🎧 **Lo-fi beats or deep techno**
- 🌙 **Midnight silence or early morning calm**
- 🌈 **Aesthetic themes (looking at you, Tokyo Night or Dracula)**
- 🔁 **Code that feels like storytelling**

## Vibe Stack

Everyone has a personal vibe stack. Mine?

- **Frontend**: React / Next.js / Tailwind
- **Backend**: Firebase / Node.js
- **Terminal**: zsh + oh-my-zsh + catppuccin theme
- **Theme**: One Dark Pro with italic comments
- **Fuel**: Coffee with oat milk

## Why It Matters

Vibe coding isn’t just fun — it helps fight burnout, unlock creativity, and remind us why we fell in love with code in the first place.

If you’ve been feeling stuck, try setting the vibe first before you code. Your mind might surprise you.
