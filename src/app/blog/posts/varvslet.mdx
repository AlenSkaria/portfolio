Thereâ€™s a certain _mood_ to writing JavaScript. But if youâ€™re still reaching for `var` in 2025, we need to talk. Because `let` isnâ€™t just syntactic sugar â€” itâ€™s a scope shift, a mindset, a vibe.

Itâ€™s like going from floppy disks to SSDs. Both store stuff, but one just _feels_ right.

## The Legacy of `var`

`var` is old school. Itâ€™s got _hoisting_, itâ€™s got _function scope_, and it sometimes leads to those WTF moments that haunt your console logs at 2 a.m.

```js
function example() {
  console.log(x); // undefined ðŸ˜µ
  var x = 10;
}
```
